Hangman.py and wordBank.txt are the source code for the project.

Hangman.exe is the one file executable version, whereas HangmanFull.zip is a directory executable version, with a wordBank file to change potential guess words.

Notes.jpg are some basic notes I took at the start of the project to shell out some of the basic ideas for the project.

This project took me approximately 3 houts.

Hope you enjoy!
